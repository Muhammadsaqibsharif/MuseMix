- View and enjoy
- Download or print
- Share on social platforms

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   The user enters a personal story, mood, or emotional memory.

2. **Emotion & Theme Analysis**  
   Using NLP models, MuseMix extracts mood, emotion, and themes from the input.

3. **Playlist Generation**  
   Songs are selected using semantic similarity to the extracted mood via the Spotify API.

4. **Poetic Descriptions**  
   GPT-4o generates short poetic blurbs for each song, reflecting the emotional tone.

5. **AI Cover Art**  
   A text-to-image model creates a visual zine cover that matches the input’s vibe.

6. **Zine Output**  
   All components are compiled into a mixtape zine in digital format (viewable and shareable).
